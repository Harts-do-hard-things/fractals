# Fractals

Constructs IFS fractals in python, Depends on the GIF package.  
Plots fractals in the complex plane.

## Installation
Clone the repo, satisfy dependendies and roll  
There are no docstrings, so you will want to look at the source code (Sorry!)

## While there aren't docstrings...
Fractal is initialized with a starting line e.g. `[0+0*1j,1+0*1j]` and a list of functions; any function will work, only some will look interesting.
Once a fractal is initalized, call `Fractal.iterate`
Then Call `plot`

A DragonFractal can be used if your functions don't create a single line

BinaryTree can be used to create [Binary trees](https://larryriddle.agnesscott.org/ifs/pythagorean/symbinarytree.htm)
